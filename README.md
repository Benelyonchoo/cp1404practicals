# CP1404 Practical Repository

## This is a repository for Benelyon Zoe Choo's weekly practicals that are required for CP1404.

## Clean code lessons:

- Variables, constants, functions, lists, dictionaries, and classes should be named according to proper conventions. Anyone else looking at your code can easily identify what things are by looking at the convention.


- Constants should be used whenever possible to avoid the use of magic numbers when they do not provide any additional clarification.


- Comments should be used meaningfully. If you want to require comments, don't overload your file with them.


- Comments can be used to remind readers or yourself how something was done or why.
